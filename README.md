# Verilog RTL Simulator 

Developed a digital simulation tool that takes a Verilog file and a test vector as inputs, simulates the circuit, and outputs the logic behavior of the design, in addition to the current state at each clock cycle.

The simulator utilizes a preprocessor to generate an intermediate circuit description, which is then interpreted by the simulation engine to accurately model the circuit's behavior.
